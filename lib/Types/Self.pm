=head1 NAME

Types::Self - provides a "Self" type constraint, referring to the caller class or role

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  {
    package Cow;
    use Moo;
  }
  
  {
    package Horse;
    use Moo;
    use Types::Self;
    use Types::Standard qw( Str );
    
    has name   => ( is => 'ro', isa => Str  );
    has mother => ( is => 'ro', isa => Self );
    has father => ( is => 'ro', isa => Self );
  }
  
  my $alice = Horse->new( name => 'Alice' );
  my $bob   = Horse->new( name => 'Bob' );
  
  # Okay
  my $baby = Horse->new(
    name   => 'Baby',
    mother => $alice,
    father => $bob,
  );
  
  # Dies
  my $baby = Horse->new(
    name   => 'Baby',
    mother => Cow->new,
    father => $bob,
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 C<< Self >>

This module exports a C<Self> type constraint which constrains values to be
blessed objects in the same class as the package it was imported into, or
blessed objects which consume the role it was imported into. It should do
the right thing with inheritance.

Using C<Self> in a class means the same as C<< InstanceOf[__PACKAGE__] >>.
(See B<InstanceOf> in L<Types::Standard>.)

Using C<Self> in a role means the same as C<< ConsumerOf[__PACKAGE__] >>.
(See B<ConsumerOf> in L<Types::Standard>.)

=head2 C<< is_Self >>

This module also exports C<is_Self>, which returns a boolean.

  package Marriage;
  use Moo::Role;
  use Types::Self qw( is_Self );
  
  has spouse => ( is => 'rwp', init_arg => undef );
  
  sub marry {
    my ( $me, $maybe_spouse ) = @_;
    if ( is_Self( $maybe_spouse ) ) {
      $me->_set_spouse( $maybe_spouse );
      $maybe_spouse->_set_spouse( $me );
    }
    else {
      warn "Cannot marry this!";
    }
    return $me;
  }

C<< is_Self( $var ) >> can also be written as C<< Self->check( $var ) >>.

=head2 C<< assert_Self >>

The module also exports C<assert_Self> which acts like C<is_Self> but instead
of returning a boolean, either lives or dies. This can be useful is you need
to check that the first argument to a function is a blessed object.

  sub connect {
    my ( $self ) = ( shift );
    assert_Self $self;  # dies if called as a class method
    $self->{connected} = 1;
    return $self;
  }

C<< assert_Self( $var ) >> can also be written as C<< Self->( $var ) >>.

=head2 C<< to_Self >>

The module also exports C<to_Self> which will attempt to coerce other types
to the B<Self> type.

C<< to_Self( $var ) >> can also be written as C<< Self->coerce( $var ) >>.

=head2 C<< coercions_for_Self >>

An easy way of adding coercions to your B<Self> type for the benefit of
C<< to_Self >>. Other classes which use C<< InstanceOf[$YourClass] >>
will also get these coercions.

Accepts a list of type+code pairs. The code can be a scalarref naming a
method to call to coerce a value, a coderef to call to coerce the value
(operating on C<< $_ >>), or a string of Perl code to call to coerce the
value (operating on C<< $_ >>).

  package MyClass;
  use Moo;
  use Types::Self -all;
  use Types::Standard qw( HashRef ArrayRef ScalarRef );

  coercions_for_Self(
    HashRef,   \'new',
    ArrayRef,  \'from_array',
    ScalarRef, sub { ... },
  );

  sub from_array {
    my ( $class, $arrayref ) = ( shift, @_ );
    ...;
  }

=head2 Exporting

Only C<Self> is exported by default.

Other functions need to be requested:

  use Types::Self -all;

Functions can be renamed:

  use Types::Self
    'Self'    => { -as => 'ThisClass' },
    'is_Self' => { -as => 'is_ThisClass' };
